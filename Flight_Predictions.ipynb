    "The sum of all of these wx (feature multiplied by constant) is the predicted Arrival Delay.  The weights can be positive or negative.  Positive weights mean that when the feature increases the predicted Arrival Delay also increases and negative weights mean that when the feature decreases, the predicted Arrival Delay increases.  If a feature's weight is closer to 0, it means that it has a negligible effect on the Arrival Delay.\n",

    "where $X$ is the train dataset, $θ$ is the vector of weights to find and $y$ is the actual Arrival Delay. The normal equation is found by setting the gradient of the loss function to 0 (and then rearranging).  The problem is that the model has to find $X^TX$ and $X$ is huge and so the matrix multiplication is very computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that Scikit-learn's LinearRegression uses QR Decomposition which is less computationally expensive.  This calculates $Q$ and $R$ where $QR = X$.  $Q$ has the same shape as $X$, but it has orthonormal columns, which means that $Q^TQ = I$.  This means that we do not need to calculate $Q^T * Q$ as the 2 matrices create an identity matrix.  $R$ is an upper triangle matrix of size $n x n$ where $n$ is the number of features.\n",

    "By using $X = QR$, we can change the normal equation$Rθ = Q^Ty$  Because $Q^Ty$ is a vector with as many values as there are features, $R$ is an upper triangle matrix of size $n * n$ where $n$ is the number of features, and $θ$ is just a vector of the weights, the model can engage in back-substitution to quickly find the optimal weights.\n",

    "# ElasticNet Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that large size of the dataframe due to the categorical features that have been one-hot-encoded, I am using ElasticNet because it includes the cost of regularisation in its cost function and so aggressively reduces the dimensionality of the dataset by setting less important features to 0.  Based on my exploratory data analysis, I suspect that many of the airlines, and even the airports will have little importance on the arrival delay and so if ElasticNet identifies this and sets those features to 0 it should help avoid overfitting and reduce the time to compute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Coordinate Descent in ElasticNet works:\n",
    "ElasticNet takes the first w value (constant) for the first x value (feature) and optimises it with regards to a loss function.  The loss function incorporates both the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and both L1 and L2 regularisation, in order to both minimise the difference between the predicted value and the actual value, as well as the amount of regularisation that is applied to the w value.  The model doesn't use gradient descent, but coordinate descent instead (in order to include L1 regularisation in its loss function).  In coordinate descent, the model finds the optimal value that minimises the loss function and sets the w value to that optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularisation is used to prevent the model from overfitting (learning the training data so well that it can't effectively predict new data).\n",
    "\n",
    "During optimisation, L1 regularisation adjusts the w value, each iteration, to reduce its size.  When the new w value is calculated by finding the importance of the feature in reducing the difference between the predicted value and the actual value, the feature may not be very important and so the w value may be below the threshold for L1 regularisation.  These w values are set to 0 because the feature's importance in reducing the loss function is less than the punishment, in the loss function, of using L1 regularisation on the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For features, whose w values are above the threshold, they are pulled towards 0, each iteration by a fixed amount by L1 regularisation.  Then, they are pulled towards 0 by L2 regularisation which does so proportionately to the w values it is adjusting. This means that it prevents the model from relying too much on a few large features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the model goes through every single w value, optimising each one, it goes back to the first w value and starts again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is repeated until the cost function reaches a minimum or the maximum number of iterations has been reached.\n",

    "ElasticNet can accept sparse data because it acts on each individual feature at a time and ignores \"0\" values."

    "# XGBRegressor Gradient Boost\n",
    "\n",
    "I am using 3 different Gradient Boosting ML models.  Gradient Boosting, through its decision trees, can handle complex interactions between the categorical and numerical data.  In a situation where flights leaving JFK in the morning having a larger arrival delay than in the morning, when this is the opposite of the usual pattern seen in my data analysis, a Gradient Boosting model, through its decision trees would be able to handle this interaction which Linear Regression would miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating the Decision Trees\n",
    "The model first creates an initial prediction by predicting the mean probability of result_train (~0.53) for every single row. It does this by putting the log-odds of result_train and putting that into a sigmoid function. The model will be calculating log-odds\n",
    "\n",
    "The model then finds the residuals (the difference between the predicted probability and the actual result) of each row. The residual is also called the gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the model selects a random subset of features (determined by colsample_by_tree), and evaluates every possible way to split the features and selects the split that best maximises the gain function.  To do this the split will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximises the square of the sum of residual values (to group together rows with similar errors).\n",
    "- And minimises the sum of Hessian values (to prioritise correcting rows where the model is confidently incorrect).\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives more weight to predicted probabilities that are very wrong. It increases the number of nodes (from 1 to 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The process repeats itself on each of the new nodes, splitting them as well, and continues to repeat until:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The \"max_depth\" (number of successive splits) is reached.\n",
    "- The sum of hessian values (of rows) at a node is less than \"min_child_weight\".\n",
    "### Calculating the Probability\n",
    "Once the tree has finished splitting the data, the model goes through each individual leaf and calculates for each row in that leaf a new probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It first calculates:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Hessian value: probability * (1 - probability)\n",
    "- The log-odds: log( probability / (1 - probability) )\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate Delta/Leaf Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All of the residual values in the leaf are added together.\n",
    "- All of the hessian values in the leaf are added together.\n",
    "- The sum of the residuals is then divided by: the sum of the hessians + L2 regularisation constant. The L2 regularisation constant is determined by \"reg_lambda\".\n",
    "- This value is then multiplied by -1 (in order to minimise, rather than maximise, the loss function). This value is Delta, and it is stored in the leaf as the Leaf Score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate updated probability for each individual row:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Delta is then multiplied by the \"learning_rate\".\n",
    "- This is added to the log-odds for each individual row. (Each row has its own log-odds but the delta is shared by all rows in that leaf.)\n",
    "- Then the new probability is calculated by putting the log-dds in the sigmoid function.\n",
    "- Finally, the new residual value is calculated by finding the difference between the new probability and the actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the model takes the new residual values and moves onto the next tree. The number of trees is determined by \"n_estimators\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting the result\n",
    "Each row is put through the first tree and follows the decision nodes until it makes it to a leaf. Once it is at a leaf, the Leaf Score of that leaf is added to the row's log-odds (which starts at 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then each row moves on to the next tree and gets a Leaf Score added to its log-odds, and then the next tree and Leaf Score, and so on. When each row has passed through every single tree, the log-odds of each row is converted to probability through the sigmoid function. If the output of the sigmoid function is above 0.5 the model predicts, for that row, that the Blue team will win, if not, it predicts that the red team will win.\n",

    "### My HyperParameters\n",

    "I will explain some of my hyperparameters that I haven't touched on so far.\n",

    "**tree_method=\"hist\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "This enables binning.  Binning is done natively by LGBMRegressor, which is the next Gradient Boosting model I will use but by setting tree_method to \"hist\" XGBRegressor can engage in Binning too.\n",
    "- This puts features into bins which reduces the number of split points needed to be evaluated at each node.\n",
    "- The Hessians and Gradients are calculated for all the values in each bin and so when a split point is evaluated the model doesn't need to add up the 5 million values again but just the 256 sums of the Hessians and Gradients for each bin.\n",
    "- Bins are re-calculated at each individual node based off of the flights in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "**enable_categorical=True**\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the model to accept categorical data without one-hot encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_jobs=-1**\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the model to use the maximum amount of computing power.\n",
    "\n",
    "**min_child_weight=500**\n",
    "\n",
    "This stops nodes from splitting and creating a leaf that would have less than 500 flights.  This helps to stop overfitting.  I have chosen a large number of 500 because my dataset is very large and my test size is over 2.5 million.\n",
    "\n",
    "**n_estimators and max_depth**\n",
    "\n",
    "I have chosen a relatively low list of potential n_estimators and a high list for max_depth.  This is because I think there will be many complicated interactions between the features (such as flights of a particular airport at a particular time, at a particular time of year, on a particular airline).  By having a large max_depth it increases the chances that the model can find and learn from these interactions.  The low n_estimators is in order to counteract the high max_depth and prevent overfitting."

    "- LGBMRegressor does not split every single leaf on a level before moving onto the next leaf and will evaluate every single leaf (on all levels) to decide which is the best split.  This means that it makes fewer low-Gain splits because it prioritises the leaves that maximise the Gain function rather than just prioritising the splits that do so and will reach its max_depth by splitting fewer leaves because it enacts fewer low-Gain splits.\n",

    "\n",
    "For the predictions however, there are a few problems.  First, the data used is only from 2015.  This means that if there was a hurricane in September, that the model will be trained on that particular hurricane but there is no guarantee that there will be a hurricane in subsequent Septembers.  The model's strong predictive accuracy could be because it is overfitting to anomalies in the data.  In order to effectively predict flights that have not yet occurred, I would need several more years worth of data.  I would also need a more powerful computer to run ML algorithms on larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the predictions are focused on flights after they take off.  Further work could be undertaken to predict flights before they take off (without using Taxi Out or Departure Delay).  This limits the effectiveness of the ML models because they could only be used once a flight is in the air to assist in finding the time of arrival rather than in informing what flights to take in the first place.  That is currently only achieved by the exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limitations of this notebook, the low r2 score of the LGBMRegressor ML model shows that Gradient Boosting models can be optimised to effectively find interactions between variables in the dataset, in order to predict the Arrival Delay of flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Applications\n",
    "- Cab companies being able to predict, to a higher accuracy, the arrival delay of arriving planes so that they can send their drivers at the optimal time.\n",
    "- Airlines and airports being able to predict the length of upcoming delays in their flights which would increase the importance\n",
    "- Individuals using the data exploration to see which airlines, airports, and airline routes to avoid.\n",
    "### Future Model Development\n",
    "- Using more years of flight data.\n",
    "- More computational power to use the extra data and to apply a larger grid search.\n",
    "- Editing the model so that it can predict flight delays in real time and creating an interface to input data so that users can utilise the model's predictive abilities."
